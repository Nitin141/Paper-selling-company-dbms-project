PROBLEM STATEMENT :

The company is organized into branches. Each branch has a unique  branch id, a name, and a particular employee who manages it.
The company makes its money by selling paper to their clients. Each client has a name and a unique number to identify it.
The foundation of company is its employees. Each employee has a name, birthday, sex, salary and a unique number.
An employee can work for one branch at a time and each branch will be managed by one of the employees that work there. We’ll also want to keep track of when the current manager started as a manager.
An employee can act as a supervisor for other employees at the branch and he may also act as the supervisor for employee at other branches. An employee can have atmost one supervisor.
A branch may handle a number of clients with each client having a name and a client id  to identify them. A single  client may only be handled by one branch at a time.
Employees can work with clients controlled by their branch to sell them product. If necessary multiple employees can work with the same client. We’ll want to keep track of the million of dollars of sales made by each employee to each client they work with.
Branches will need to work with suppliers to buy inventory. For each supplier we’ll keep track of their name and type of product they are selling the branch. A single supplier may supply products to multiple branches.
